# colbss-geospatial

This is a script for qb-core that gives a few navigation features, including a compass and a postal finder.

<u>**NOTE:**</u> The main functions of this script are <u>NOT</u> made by me. I have only combined / tweaked parts of other scripts into this one script.

Compass used from:
https://gitlab.com/MsQuerade/Compass-and-street-name-HUD

Postals used from:
https://github.com/DevBlocky/nearest-postal

The postal functionality is intended for: https://forum.cfx.re/t/free-release-postal-code-map-minimap-fixed/4882127

### Commands
`/compass` - Toggle the compass on and off

`/postal <postal code>` - Place a waypoint to the specified postal. Will only show for you.
